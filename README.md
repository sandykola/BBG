The Data License Web Services WSDL can be found [here](https://service.bloomberg.com/assets/dl/dlws.wsdl).

**NOTE**: The WSDL is an API to Data License Web Services. A typical use case is to generate the code one time using the WSDL. This should not be used as part of the daily workflow. In the event the WSDLâ€™s content changes, proper notice will be sent through our notification service. Clients are advised to not programatically download the WSDL every time they get data, as the WSDL availability should not be critical path for daily workflow.


For further information about the sample code and WSDL, please refer to the Data License User Guide.
